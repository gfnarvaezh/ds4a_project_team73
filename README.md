This project intends to provide an independent and objective view of the social and economic factors that
can affect or determine the score of each student in the state test of Colombia (Saber 11). We strongly
believe that the outputs of this study will have an impact in the society we live in, especially if we consider
the main finding of the Colombian wise men convention 25 years ago: “only education can give us a better
country”.

## About the app

  * View by State (department): Summary by department. It has the same functionalities as the country tab, but includes a dropdown to specify the department.
  * View by city (municipality): Summary by municipality. In this case, it includes the results by school. 
* Simulator: Simulation of the results for an individual student according to its socioeconomic  data. 
* Forecasting and testing: Prescriptive tool to analyze the effects of changes in the socioeconomic data of a group of students. This tool allows to simulate and compare 2 different scenarios.
